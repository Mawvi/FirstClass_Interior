This project is to showcase our individual ability to work together as a team while doing our desiignated/ deligated tasks that contribute to our project.
We collectively create a website for our hyperthetical clients by asking them questionaires and interview questions to get their specific requirements and then we forge a wireframe to give them a preview of what thier expected webpages would look like and we do the coding bit to the specifications that they have provided for us and we test the functionality is up to the standards that our clients are happy with and then we will eventually present the finshed product to our clients.
Our Group consists of a Proggrammer, Business Analyst, Designer and a Tester.
